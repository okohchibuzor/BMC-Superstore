## Introduction
I worked on the sales data of **BMC Superstore** with branches in different cities in the United States.This project includes insights and recommendations for the four regions of the store and annswers business questions to enhance the efficiency of the stores. 

## Problem Statements
The task was to build a dashboard that would easily answer the following questions:
1. What was the total sales and profit made by BMC Superstore?
2. Which customer made BMC the most profit in each of the four regions?
3. Which customer made the most purchases in each region?
4. Which product was sold the most in each of the regions?
